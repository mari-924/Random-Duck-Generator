Hello, and Welcome to my first Hackathon project!

This project was made at CalHacks 2023 by myeself Mariana Duran.
This project is a webapplication made completely in Python using the Python library
called Reflex.

Reflex allows you to make web applications only using python, so you won't have to use anything else except Python.

The web application I made uses and API called Random Duck and is used to create random duck
images and gifs everytime you click the button.

While making the project there were some bumps in the road, the biggest issue was that my webpage would make a ghost backport, so essentially when I would run the webpage nothing would happen but yet it showed that it was working. I was working on the project for the majority of the two days with this issue and thought it was my code. Until I finally tried making the project on a different laptop and was finally able to make this small project on the last day with little time.

And with that the random ruck generator was born.
